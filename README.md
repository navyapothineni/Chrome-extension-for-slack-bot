# Chrome extension for slack bot
 To use, edit the js file with the Slack incoming webhook url, a username and a channel name.
 Unpack the extension on your browser window and use the extension to post a link to the slack channel by clicking on the extension.
 The extension shows the status of the request and displays "Done!" when the post was successful or displays the error code.
 You can also edit the post request to suit your needs.
